## 📊 Overview
This project explores the impact of regulations on Airbnb listings using data from New York City. The dataset includes detailed information such as listing price, room type, number of reviews, availability, and more.  
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identify trends in listing growth, pricing behavior, guest reviews, and the influence of city regulations over time.  
This analysis helps in understanding how legal and market changes affect short-term rentals.

## 💡 Final Insights

1. Since the launch, the number of Airbnbs increased and prices rose due to initial traction and early adopters.  
2. As Airbnb became mainstream, listing counts increased, and prices dropped due to competition.  
3. In 2015, regulation announcements led to underconfidence; listings dropped, and prices rose.  
4. By 2019, regulations became normalized; listings rose again, and prices declined due to supply.
