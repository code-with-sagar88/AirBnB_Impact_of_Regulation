## Overview :
This project explores the impact of regulations on Airbnb listings using data from New York City. The dataset includes detailed information such as listing price, room type, number of reviews, availability, and more. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identify trends in listing growth, pricing behavior, guest reviews, and the influence of city regulations over time. This analysis helps in understanding how legal and market changes affect short-term rentals.

## Dataset :
TThis project uses publicly available Airbnb data from New York City, consisting of the following files:

- `listings.csv`  
  Contains property-level information such as host ID, room type, price, minimum nights, availability, and number of reviews.

- `reviews.csv`  
  Includes guest reviews with review dates and reviewer IDs, helpful in analyzing review trends over time.

## Insights :
1. Entire home/apartment listings dominate the Airbnb market in NYC, followed by private rooms.
2. Prices for entire homes are significantly higher compared to shared or private rooms.
3. The number of Airbnb listings increased steadily from 2010 to 2014, indicating initial growth and adoption.
4. A decline in new listings is observed around 2015, possibly due to regulatory actions, while prices saw a sharp rise during this period.
5. Post-2019, listings began increasing again and average prices started to decline, suggesting market adaptation to regulations.
6. The number of reviews also followed a similar trend â€” increasing during growth years and dropping around regulation periods.

## Recommendation :
1. Airbnb should closely monitor changes in local regulations, especially in high-density urban markets like New York City, to adapt its strategy accordingly.
2. During regulatory shifts, Airbnb can focus on improving customer experience and host onboarding quality to retain trust on the platform.
3. Introducing transparent pricing and compliance support tools for hosts may help reduce the negative impact of regulation-related uncertainty.
4. Airbnb should diversify room offerings and optimize pricing models based on room type performance (e.g., entire homes vs. private rooms).
5. Proactively engaging with local governments can help Airbnb prepare better for upcoming legal changes and ensure long-term sustainability.
